        <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Background</h2>
        <p class = "project-text">
          To solve the reocurring problem of terrible listening experiences
          whenever my friends and I are playing music in the car,
          I decided to make a prototype feature I would want introduced into the Spotify
           mobile application called Rooms. Rooms would create a new, fast way of sharing music for any occassion,
            whether that be in the car or at a party.
        </p>

        <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Problem</h2>
        <p class = "project-text">
        Every time my friends and I are in the car together, the music listening
        experience is always terrible. With people arguing for the aux cord,
        who gets to queue music, and terrible song selection, the list goes on forever.
        As the driver, this can be extremely distracting and unsafe.</p>

        <p>After thinking about the main problem to this terrible music listening
        experience, I concluded that the problem was that only one person's music
        taste was being played.</p>

        <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Solution</h2>
        <p>To fix this problem, I decided that I would design a new feature in the
        Spotify mobile application that would allow for better group listening through
        a democracy type experience. This would not only improve car rides, but
        every group event possible.</p>


        <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Design Process</h2>
        <p>While creating the design of this new feature,
          it was important that the aesthetic was clean and simple while still
          being able to meet all core features. Through this process I kept in mind
          that often the best applications require the least amount of steps to use.
          Additionally, I chose to use Spotify as the main platform as it's my
          favorite music streaming service and the most popular amongst my friends.
        </p>

               Passengers can then add songs to the play queue by clicking the "Add Songs" button where they will be
                introduced to the same song search menu they're familiar to in the Spotify application.</p>

              <p>By introducing a vote kicking functionality, unwanted songs will be removed with a 2/3 majority vote.
              This would ensure that only the best songs are being played, making the
            listening experience great for all passengers</p>

         <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Challenges</h2>
          <p>Building an entire user interface and experience by yourself is
             challenging. Some design challenges I faced include:</p>
             <ul>
              <li>How can I create the easiest way for users to join a Room?</li>
              <li>How can the Rooms feature be safe for drivers?</li>
              <li>How can I reach out and promote my product?</li>
             </ul>

          <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Takeaways</h2>
           <p>This project was super motivating for me to increase my skills
             as a designer and to learn more about the UI/UX field. This was my first
             ever project focussing on the user interface and experience flow of an application.
             I am very happy with the work that I put in to this project and the solution I came up
              with to create a new way to share music at group events.</p>
