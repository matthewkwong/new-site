      <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Background</h2>
      <p class = "project-text">
      After taking a summer class on HTML & CSS in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco,
       one of the largest homeless populations in San Francisco I was shocked by the homeless problem.
        I knew there was no solution, but I wanted to create somethign that would help those on the streets.
         Given the opportunity to build an application at Cal Hacks 5.0,
         my team - Yash Dani, Brandon Lau, and I were able to create Help the
          Homies.
      </p>

      <h2 class = "project-subtitle">How It Works</h2>
      <p>With our web application, users are able to identify homeless people in their
      local communitites and mark the needs of the homeless person and a brief description
      of what they look like and the nearby location</p>

      <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Processes</h2>
      <p>Originally called Help the Homeless, I chose to change the name because homeless
        people are often forgotten as part of society. By referring to them as
        homies, I wanted to say that they were friends and people that we remembered.</p>

      <p>This was my first time leading a group coding project and it was a very
         unique experience. Through this experience, I taught my team members how to use
          Github and came up with the layout design plan.</p>

     <p>With 36 hours to develop this application, I was in charge of learning and implementing the Google Maps API.
        I had worked with JavaScript before, but had never made used an API before.
        There were some roadblocks here and there to understand the implementation, but
      we were successfully able to create new pin points on a given map using Firebase to store data.</p>


     <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Summary</h2>
      <p>In the course of a weekend, I was able to learn so much. It was the
        first hackathon I had ever been to and it changed the way I viewed coding
       in several ways. After the hackathon, I continued working on the project
        by myself in hopes to have a final product that would be used by people.</p>


      <p>Unfortunately, the Maps API was depricated in late 2018 / early 2019 so
         I was unable to continue working on the project. Additionally, we ran out
         of Google Cloud Platform credit to continue paying for the Maps API.</p>
