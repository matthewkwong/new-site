      <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Background</h2>
      <p class = "project-text">
      Throughout my senior year of high school I interned at a local
      non-profit in San Francisco that helped start after school coding clubs
      called Hack Club. Throughout my internship I helped develop an online
      curriculum to teach web development, managed promotional campaigns,
      operated an outreach program, and prepared welcome packages for new
      members who joined our organization.
      </p>


      <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Projects</h2>
      <h3 class = "project-sub-subtitle">Curriculum Redesign</h3>

      <p>One of my first tasks as an intern at Hack Club was to revise the
         online curriculum that taught students HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
         This involved going through the existing workshops and redesigning them
         to be understand at a high school level.
     </p>

     <h3 class = "project-subtitle">Social Media Outreach</h3>
      <p>
        Additionally, I led a promotional social media campaign on Facebook where I
        learned to use Facebook advertising, creating content to promote the
        company’s presence. Through this experience I was able to learn more about
         advertising processes and what target platforms we should focus on.
      </p>

      <h3 class = "project-subtitle">Email Outreach</h3>
      <p>Throughout my entire time at Hack Club, I operated an outreach program
        where we were able to advertise and contact over 15,000 high schools
        in the United States.</p>

      <h3 class = "project-subtitle">Sticker Welcome Packages</h3>
      <p>As part of the onboarding process I helped package and send onboarding
        packages of Hack Club stickers given to each new branch
        joining the organization.</p>

      <h2 class = "project-subtitle">Takeaways</h2>
      <p>This experience changed my life in many ways as I learned professional
        workplace skills in responsiblity and teamwork.</p>

      <p>A great part of Hack Club is the online Slack channel where students
        across the world are able to communicate with one another. Since leaving
        my internship at Hack Club, I have seen students that I had personally
        reached out to to join Hack Club, positively impact how the organization
        runs. I’m so grateful for the time I was able to spend at Hack Club
        and thrilled that I was able to make a positive impact on others lives.</p>
